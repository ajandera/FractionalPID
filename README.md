# FractionalPID

Arduino library to calculate u by fractional non linear PID controller.

## Description

This is a simple Arduino library used to demonstrate fractional PID non linear regulator developed by prof. Ing. Ivo Petr치코, DrSc.

This library example is basd on Matlab file exchange of prof. Ing. Ivo Petr치코, DrSc. [Non-Linear Fractional-Order PID Controller](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/51190-non-linear-fractional-order-pid-controller).

Example implementation based on [Automationshield](http://www.automationshield.com) found in example/AeroShield.ino

To make an instalable zip file of the library easily download in a zip format from github and load it in the Arduino ide.
